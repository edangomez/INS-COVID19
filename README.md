# COVID19 Status classification models

This repo contains all the files of the classification model built in order to predict the status of a COVID19 patient. We propose 2 different models trained with INS public domain data on positives cases in colombia.

For that purpose, the pipeline for training and testing is defined as follows:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Preprocessing
- Training models for prediction
- Model comparison

As a result of the above pipeline, a multi-class Support Vector Machine was selected as the best model for prediciton of patient state.
